I invite you to familiarize yourself with my portfolio project <b>Finance Organizer</b>. This is a service that allows you to keep convenient records of financial expenses. All expenses are divided into appropriate categories. The user can add new expenses at any time (a so-called transaction). A special convenience of the service is the ability to get your expenses for a certain time. The user can view expenses both in monetary units and as a percentage. You can delete transactions one by one, starting from the end. To use the service, you need to create an account.
