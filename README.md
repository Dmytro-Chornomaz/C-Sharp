üî• I invite you to familiarize yourself with my portfolio project <b>Finance Organizer</b>. This is a service that allows you to keep convenient records of financial expenses. All expenses are divided into appropriate categories. The user can add new expenses at any time (a so-called transaction). A special convenience of the service is the ability to get your expenses for a certain time. The user can view expenses both in monetary units and as a percentage. You can delete transactions one by one, starting from the end. To use the service, you need to create an account. 

‚òùÔ∏è This is the back-end part of my portfolio project Finance Organizer. To see the front-end part of the project use link to my <a href="https://github.com/Dmytro-Chornomaz/React/tree/main/finance_organizer" target="_blank">React repo</a>.

üñ• Here are screenshots of some of the elements of my application that will give you a better understanding of how my project looks and functions.
