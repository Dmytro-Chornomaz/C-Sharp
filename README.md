I invite you to familiarize yourself with my pet project Finance Organizer. It is an application for convenient management of household financial affairs. The application allows you to record your expenses in the appropriate categories and receive a report on expenses for any period of time. This report can be provided both in monetary terms and in percentage terms. My project is gradually developing. I encourage you to leave comments. Thank you for reading!
